Each line of pixels. All looped and striped?? How is such strategy called?
A lot of those.
What about potential 'life' formations??
I.e. collections of games?

Success: Neural ARchitecture Search.
First small dataset, test it on a large one.

Recursion.
Use multiple data sets.
What objects does it explain (assuming this is programmed).
OpenAI - Meta Learning & Self Play - Ilya Sutskever


Hierarchical RL

Small collections of life like phenomena.

  How it works: "Codistillation trains n copies of a model in parallel by adding a term to the loss function of the ith model to match the average prediction of the other models." This approach is superior to distributed stochastic gradient descent in terms of accuracy and training time and is also not too bad from a reproducability perspective.
  
  Thus: to have spare time invested in other areas makes for a good problem solver.
